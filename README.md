Some coding projects I did for fun

Hernan Cortes Quest: Official title is "The Important Expedition of Hernán Cortés", text adventure based on reading material from Textual Analysis and Argumentation course. Hernán Cortés makes various observations of the naitive people and their culture when he arrives on new land. Primarily C# code, runs in the Quest game engine.

OEIS_getter: an OEIS API in Python I made for one of the clubs I attend. Enter the ID of a desired sequence and it will retrieve both the sequence and its graph.

colour-based-tracking-shape-detection: A C++ program that performs both colour based object tracking (red) and shape detection (only works on quadrilaterals currently) on live camera feed.
