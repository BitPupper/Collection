The main streets are very wide and straight; some of them and the smaller ones are half on land, half on canals where the people paddle their canoes. All of the streets have openings to let water pass from one canal to another. Over these canals lie bridges, made of long and wide beams joined together so firmly that you estimate 10 horsemen could ride on them without any trouble.<br/><br/>You are also quick to notice, due to your experience as a Conquistador, that the city is designed skillfully so that once the bridges are removed, those on the mainland would be trapped and starved to death. You start to get slightly anxious. What if the inhabitants betray you and your men? Maybe destroying the ships so quickly wasn't such a good idea. Oops.<br/><br/>{once:But not to worry, the men will do all the work for you. Just "tell to..." build the brigantines and they will carry out the order!}<br/>]]></description>
